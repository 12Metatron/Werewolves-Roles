**Lupine Cupid** | Solo Killing
__Basics__
The Lupine Cupid is a cupid whose lover is a member of the werewolf team or wolfpack.
__Details__
If the cupid selects a lover from the wolf team or wolfpack, the cupid turns into a Lupine Cupid.
The Lupine Cupid works like the cupid, with a few exceptions: The Lupine Cupid cannot be killed by the werewolves.
Additionally, they are a lycan, but do not join the pack. On even numbered nights, the Lupine Cupid may attack a member of the wolfpack.
