**Infected Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
In the first night, the Infected Wolf must choose one player to convert to a wolf.
__Details__
If the Infected Wolf fails to choose a player after the first night, a random player will be selected for them. This ability can only be used once. 
Infecting a player is an immediate ability. Members of the wolfpack canâ€™t be infected. 
If a devil, demon, archangel or saint is picked the power backfires and the infected wolf becomes a demon or saint.
