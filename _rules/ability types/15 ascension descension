**Ascension & Descension**
Unaligned players may leave the game early with either a win (ascension) or a loss (descension). This happens when they complete their win condition, or when winning becomes impossible for them. When players ascend it will be treated as if they died or if they descend they die, and their ascension/descension, as well as their role will be announced.
