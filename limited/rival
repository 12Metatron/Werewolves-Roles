**Rival** | Townsfolk Group
__Basics__
The Rivals is like the baker group, a group of trusted players; except for the fact that all Rivals want each other dead!
__Details__
There is always more than one Rival. All the Rivals have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Rivals securely. 
While the Rivals are members of the townsfolk team, a Rival can only win when townsfolk team wins, and when they are the last Rival remaining alive.
