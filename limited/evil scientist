**Evil Scientist** | Solo Killing - Disease Team
__Basics__
The Evil Scientist has invented a new disease, lethal and highly contagious. Their desire is to kill off all players.
__Details__
They starts off with two (or three for larger games) vials of a substrate containing the disease. 
During every night, they may use one of their vials to infect another player. Infected players will be affected by the disease.
If the Evil Scientist attempts to infect an already infected player, they are informed, but the vial is used up.
Infecting a player is an end-night ability. Infected players are contagious, and remains so till their death.
Any player who visits or is visited by a contagious player is immediately infected. 
At the start of the first night after being infected the player is informed that they are infected.
At the end of the second night after being infected the player will die (cannot be avoided).
