**Uncertain Hag** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__
The Uncertain Hag can win with any team, unless that team has wronged the hags. The Uncertain Hag will turn into another hag at the end of the day.
__Details__
The Uncertain Hag is one of the hags (`$i hags`).
At the start of the game, the Uncertain Hag may name one type of hag. 
At the end of the day the Uncertain Hag turns into one of the other hags, however they can not become the one they named nor can they immediately become a bitter hag.
If the Uncertain Hag doesn't choose they can turn into any of the other hag roles (except bitter hag).
The Uncertain Hag does not have a spell at the start of the game, but gains one later, as they turn into another hag.
